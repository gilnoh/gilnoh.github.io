# Dr. Tae-Gil Noh

**Machine Learning Engineer** | **NLP Specialist** | **Production AI Expert**

I'm a machine learning engineer with over 10 years of experience bringing Natural Language Processing research into production systems. Currently, I work at [OMQ GmbH](https://www.omq.de/) in Berlin, Germany, where I build AI-powered customer service solutions that serve hundreds of international customers.

## Background

I hold a PhD in NLP. My [research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PTcTzywAAAAJ&hl=en) has contributed to advancing both theoretical understanding and practical applications of language technologies. Since 2015, I've focused on translating cutting-edge research into scalable production systems.

## What I Do

My passion lies at the intersection of research and productionâ€”taking cutting-edge NLP concepts and transforming them into robust, scalable systems that solve real-world problems. Over the past decade, I've focused on:

- **Production NLP Systems**: Building and deploying language models at scale
- **Customer Service AI**: Developing intelligent automation for customer support
- **Research to Practice**: Bridging the gap between academic papers and production code
- **Multilingual NLP**: Working with systems that serve diverse international audiences
